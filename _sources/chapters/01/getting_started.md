# Getting Started

* What is programming?

## Computers

* A modern computer can be defined as "a machine that **stores** and **manipulates** information.
  * **manipulation** means to transform information into new, useful forms, and then store, output, or display information for our interpretation.
    * **Examples**:
      * Find students with the highest and lowest GPA
      * Sort the monthly sales of a bakery to determine which months have the highest sales
      * Predict house prices based on historical data

## What is a Program?

* A computer program is a detailed step-by-step set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do
* If we **change** the program, then the computer performs a different sequence of actions and hence, performs a different task.
* A program is written using these few basic operations. Using these basic operations, you can "teach" a computer new operations by defining them in terms of the basic operations.
  * **Example**: Computers understand addition and division operators, which are basic mathematical operators. You can teach the computer to calculate the average using the addition and division operators by instructing the computer to add all the numbers in a sequence and divide by the sequence size.

## What is a Programming Language?

* Natural languages are fraught with ambiguity and imprecision.
  * **English example**: "I saw a man on a hill with a telescope"
    * There is a man on a hill, and I am watching him with my telescope
    * There is a man on a hill, who I am seeing, and he has a telescope
    * There is a man, and he is on a hill that also has a telescope on it
    * I am on a hill, and I saw a man using a telescope
    * There is a man on a hill, and I am sawing him with a telescope.

* Computer scientists have solved this problem by designing notations for expressing computations precisely and unambiguously.
* These special notations are called "programming languages."
* Similar to natural languages, there are many programming languages. But they all are instructions that a machine can understand. Programming languages can also look different. For example `3 + 4` in R means add three and four. This same
instruction in Schema is expressed as `(+ 3 4)`. They are both expressing the same idea; they look different.
* Every programming language has a way to write mathematical expressions, repeat instructions several times, choose which instructions based on the current information you have, and much more.
* Programming languages take a **high-level** language, which are human-readable language expressions such as `3 + 4`, and translate it to machine language that the computer can execute.
