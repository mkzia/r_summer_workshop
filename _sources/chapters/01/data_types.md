# Data Types

R provides six basic data types. In R, they are called "atomic data types". We will be covering three of them.

1. numeric: any number, with or without decimals. Examples: 3.14, 2023, 56
2. character: a character or string. These are surrounded by a single or double quote.  Examples: 'a', "ABCD"
3. logical: TRUE or FALSE

To check the data type use `class()` function.

```R
class(1)
class(3.4)
class('a')
class("ABCD")
class(TRUE)
class(FALSE)
```
